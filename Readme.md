Original plugin base was made by `HUNjozsi`
In respect of this their name remains in the info.json

## MOD MAKERS
- Currently all mods are put in `IntoTheRadius2/Content/Paks/Mods` regardless of how you pack it, 
- Ignore `Invalid Installer` Errors for now, 
- You DO NEED UE2SS, I reccomend using [This Version](https://www.nexusmods.com/intotheradius2/mods/20/)
